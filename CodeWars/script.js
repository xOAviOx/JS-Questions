
// 1. In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

// Examples
// makeNegative(1);    // return -1
// makeNegative(-5);   // return -5
// makeNegative(0);    // return 0
// makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
// Notes
// The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
// Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

Answer 1.function makeNegative(num) {
  // Code?
  if(num>0){
    return Number(`-${num}`)
  }else if(num<0){
    return Number(num)
  }else{
    return Number(0)
  }
}
console.log(makeNegative(-42));

// 2.Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

// Examples (Input -> Output):
// * "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
// * "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
// * "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "

Answer2. function doubleChar(str) {
  let result = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    result += str[i] + str[i]; // Concatenate the character twice
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(doubleChar('String'));

//3.Write a function that removes the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

// Examples:

// Input -> Output
// "8 j 8   mBliB8g  imjB8B8  jl  B" -> "8j8mBliB8gimjB8B8jlB"
// "8 8 Bi fk8h B 8 BB8B B B  B888 c hl8 BhB fd" -> "88Bifk8hB8BB8BBBB888chl8BhBfd"
// "8aaaaa dddd r     " -> "8aaaaaddddr"

Answer.3 function noSpace(x){
  return x.replace(/ /g, '');
}
console.log(noSpace('8 j 8   mBliB8g  imjB8B8  jl  B'));

//4.Your function takes two arguments:

// current father's age (years)
// current age of his son (years)
// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old). The answer is always greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.

Answer.function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
  // your code here
  const diff = dadYearsOld - 2 * sonYearsOld;
  
  return Math.abs(diff)
}
console.log(twiceAsOld(40, 18));

// 5.Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

// Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

// Example:

// Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
// Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

Answer. // Adding the JadenString method to the String prototype
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function() {
  const words = this.split(' '); // Split the string into an array of words

  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    // Capitalize the first letter of each word and append the rest of the word
    words[i] = words[i][0].toUpperCase() + words[i].substr(1);
  }

  // Join the array of words back into a single string and return it
  return words.join(' ');
};

// Example usage:
console.log("How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real".toJadenCase());
// Output: "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

//6.
